# Exercises for the Data Visualization Presentation

## 1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see? Why?
Click on Hint to get an explanation.

```{r exer1, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

<div id="exer1-hint">
**Explanation**  The ggplot function is the first layer of your graphic. Its job
is to create a blank canvas for you to create your masterpiece on. `data = mpg`
tells ggplot you plan to use the mpg dataset for your graphic.
</div>

## 2. How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?

```{r exer2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r vizquiz1, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz 1",
    question("How many rows are in the mpg dataset?",
             answer("230"),
             answer("234", correct = TRUE),
             answer("244"),
             answer("236"),
             allow_retry = TRUE,
             random_answer_order = TRUE
             ),
    question("How many columns are in the mpg datasaet",
             answer("12"),
             answer("15"),
             answer("11", correct = TRUE),
             answer("10"),
             allow_retry = TRUE,
             random_answer_order = TRUE
             )
)
```

```{r exer2-solution}
nrow(mpg)
ncol(mpg)
```

## 3. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for mpg to find out.

```{r exer3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r exer3-solution}
?mpg
```

## 4. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

```{r exer4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r exer4-hint-1}
ggplot(mpg) +
     # Add your geom, remember, scatterplot go by a different geom name
```

```{r exer4-hint-2}
ggplot(mpg) +
     geom_point() # Add your aesthetic
```

```{r exer4-hint-3}
ggplot(mpg) +
     geom_point(aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```

## 5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?

```{r exer5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r exer5-solution}
ggplot(mpg) +
     geom_point(aes(x = class, y = drv))
```

## 6. Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

```{r exer6, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

<div id="exer6-hint">
**Explanation**  Since you are setting the color manually, it needs to be set outside of the 
aes() mapping. `ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")`
</div>

## 7. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type ?mpg to read the
documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run mpg?

```{r exer7, exercise = TRUE}

```

## 8. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for
categorical vs. continuous variables?

```{r exer8, exercise = TRUE}

```

## 9. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

```{r exer9, exercise = TRUE}

```

## 10. What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)

This vignette may provide some answers.

[Aesthetic Specifications](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/ggplot2-specs.html)

```{r exer10, exercise = TRUE}

```

## 11. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour =
displ < 5)?

```{r exer11, exercise = TRUE}

```

## 12.  What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

## 13.  What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean?
    How do they relate to this plot?
    
    ```{r exer13, exercise = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
    ```

## 14.  What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?

    ```{r exer14, exercise = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(drv ~ .)
    
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
    ```

## 15.  Take the first faceted plot in this section:

    ```{r exer15, exercise = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
    ```
    
    What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic?
    What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a 
    larger dataset?
    
## 16.  Read `?facet_wrap`. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other
    options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn't
    `facet_grid()` have `nrow` and `ncol` argument?

## 17.  When using `facet_grid()` you should usually put the variable with more
    unique levels in the columns. Why?
    
18.  What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? 
    A histogram? An area chart?

## 19.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like.

    Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.
    
    ```{r exer19, exercise = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

## 20.  What does `show.legend = FALSE` do?  What happens if you remove it?  
    Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

## 21.  What does the `se` argument to `geom_smooth()` do?


## 22.  Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

    ```{r exer22, exercise = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth()
    
    ggplot() + 
      geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
    ```

## 23.  Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.

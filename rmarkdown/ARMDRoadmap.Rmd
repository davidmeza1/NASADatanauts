## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readxl)
library(timevis)
ARMDdata <- read_excel("~/OneDrive/GitHub/NASADatanauts/data/ARMDdata.xlsx", 
                       na = "NA")
ARMDgroups <- read_excel("~/OneDrive/GitHub/NASADatanauts/data/ARMDgroups.xlsx", 
                         na = "NA")
timevis(data = ARMDdata, groups = ARMDgroups, width = 1400)
```
